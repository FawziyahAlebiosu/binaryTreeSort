# binaryTreeSort
This project built for my Data Structures course, takes in a set of integers (whole numbers AND fractions), and sorts them based off the preference they indicate(in decreasing or increasing order) and displays it. It does this by building a binary tree with the input, and sorts it using inOrderWalk, and postOrderWak methods.
